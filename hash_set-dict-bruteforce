# You're given strings jewels representing the types of stones that are jewels,
# and stones representing the stones you have. Each character in stones is a type of stone you have. 
# You want to know how many of the stones you have are also jewels.
# Letters are case sensitive, so "a" is considered a different type of stone from "A".
